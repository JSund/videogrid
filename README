Video mixer that displays a grid of video streams and allows the user to select
one of them for further processing, used at the ACM ICPC world finals to select
which contestant webcam stream to send to video production of the live event.

The code is currently very specialized for the ICPC Live project and requires a
Redis server available on localhost with the hosts to fetch the video data from.
If you are interested in using the software for other means and have any
questions regarding how to use it, please contact the authors.
